Program was made on lab computers using netbeans so it's recommended to use netbeans.

To use program:
Open up terminal
Type "netbeans" and load my assignment in as a new project.
Compile and run. 

Be warned the output for the program can be exetremely misleading; As far as I'm aware 
all functionality has been done except for the validating that the start of a subroute
and the end of the super route is within 10 m and 2 m. Everything else is implemented and
fully working.
